\chapter{Appendices} \label{appA}

\textbf{At least one submitted or published journal article is required.}  The examination versions of the thesis must include, as an appendix, published papers; unpublished manuscripts that have been submitted for publication; and manuscripts ready for, or very close to, journal submission.  These should be placed immediately after the final pages of the thesis, and separated from the thesis itself by a single dividing page with the text: ``Previously published articles associated with the research described in this thesis'', or similar. These published papers are included solely for reference by your examiners, and to show that you satisfy the graduation requirement for at least one submitted article.  They will not be included in the on-line version of the thesis once your revisions have been accepted. Papers co-authored during the period of the thesis that do not include material presented in this work should not be included.
